React api project 
Description: This project was created using react js and tailwind css. In this project i used the api link provided by my tutor to fetch data from the api and show it to the user. 
There is also a filter method to show diffrent content based on buttons and user clicks.
Map function was used in order to write efficient code to create multiple cards using only small lines of code
In order to make sure the api was working correctly the try catch block was used to detect any errors and show them in the console to debug them
Also to make sure when data was arrving from the code it will not affect the other functions or any other processes the api call was wrapped up in a async function and the receiving of data and turning it to json from string was awaited so that the code will not crash.
